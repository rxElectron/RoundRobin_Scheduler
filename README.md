## 📜 Description

This project simulates process scheduling using the Round Robin algorithm. The simulation manages multiple processes, each with specified CPU and I/O times. The processes are executed and visualized using a graphical user interface.

### ✨ Key Features

| Feature                 | Description                                                            |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🕹️ Process Scheduling   | Implements the Round Robin scheduling algorithm for process management.|
| 📊 Graphical Visualization | Real-time graphical interface to visualize process states and execution.|
| 📈 Detailed Metrics     | Reports process metrics such as waiting time, response time, and turnaround time.|

## 💾 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/therboy/RoundRobin_Scheduler.git
   cd RoundRobin_Scheduler
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the simulation:**

   Navigate to the `src` directory and execute the `Main.py` script.

   ```bash
   cd src
   python Main.py
   ```

2. **Input File:**

   The `input/Input.txt` file contains the initial processes with their respective CPU and I/O times.

3. **Graphical User Interface:**

   The GUI allows you to start, add, and retry processes. It also displays the Gantt chart for process execution.

| `src/__SRCs.py`    | 📚 Contains auxiliary functions and standard libraries.                     |
| `src/__PROCESS.py` | 🏭 Defines the `PROCESS` class, which simulates each process with attributes like ID, priority, and execution behavior. |
| `src/__IO.py`      | 📥 Handles reading process input from a text file and includes the `TextRedirector` class to manage output redirection. |
| `src/__OS.py`      | 🖥️ Implements the `OS` class for process management, including adding, removing, and running processes using Round Robin scheduling. |
| `src/__GUI.py`     | 🖼️ Provides a graphical user interface for the simulation, utilizing `tkinter` and `threading` for real-time updates. |
| `src/Main.py`      | 🚪 The main entry point of the program, which initializes and runs the application. |
